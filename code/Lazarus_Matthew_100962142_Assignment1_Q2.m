%% Question 2: Collisions with Mean Free Path (MFP)
% In this question, a number of electrons are randomly positioned within a
% set grid. With the system set to 300K, each electron is assigned velocity components based off of
% the Gaussian distribution. When an electron hits the top of the
% grid, it bounces back, and when it hits the side of the grid, it
% continues its trajectory from the opposite side of the grid.
% Additionally, there is a probability of scattering at each time step for
% each electron.

% Clear all previous variables, figures, etc, to ensure that the workspace
% is clean.

vth = sqrt(C.kb*300/(0.26*C.m_0));

%Find Mean Free Path
tmn = 0.2*10^-12;
freePath = tmn * vth; 

% Set the number of electrons, time step and total time. Initialize
% matrices for the x and y positions, the x and y components of the
% velocity, and the temperature of the system. Column 1 of each matrice is
% the previous value, while column 2 is the current value.
numElectrons=20000;
dt = 6e-15; %seconds
nTime = 1.2e-11; %Simulation length

% scatter, for each electron. Additionally initalize a counter for them.
distanceSinceLastScatter = zeros(numElectrons,1);
timeSinceLastScatter = zeros(numElectrons,1);
scatterCount = 0;

%%
% Now, randomly assign initial positions & velocities. Choose each velocity
% component based off of the Gaussian distribution. Divide by the square
% root of 2 as there are 2 degrees of freedom. This is derived from
% equating the acceleration of the electron to its kinetic energy, as seen
% by the equation below. 
%
% $$({1/2})mv^2= ({2/2})kT$$

for electronCount = 1:numElectrons
    x(electronCount,2)=rand()*200e-9;
    y(electronCount,2)=rand()*100e-9;
    
    vx(electronCount,2) = vth * randn()/sqrt(2);
    vy(electronCount,2) = vth * randn()/sqrt(2);
    vTotal(electronCount,2)= sqrt(vx(electronCount,2)^2+vy(electronCount,2)^2);
end

%% Histogram
% Create a histogram showing the speed distribution of the electrons. As
% each component was randomly chosen using a Gaussian distribution, the
% total distribution should resemble a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution. 

figure(3)
bins = linspace(0, 5*vth, 100);
h = histogram(vTotal(1:electronCount,2),bins);
title('Electron Speed Histogram');
xlabel('Electron Speed (m/s)');
ylabel('Count');

%The mean velocity is: 
meanVel = mean(vTotal(1:electronCount,2));

%% 
% Therefore, the mean velocity of the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution is $1.17 * 10^5 m/s$,
% which is slightly lower than the expected value of $1.3224*10^5 m/s$. This difference in
% the values is expected, and is due to the randomness of the assigned
% velocity components. 

% Create a figure for the electron trajectories and the temperature of the
% system.

% Define a vector that will indicate whether an electron crosses a horizontal 
% boundary. As only 5 electrons will be plotted, if the electron cross the
% boundary, a 1 will be set in the position of the vector that corresponds
% to the number of the electron (1-5).
xBreakpoint = zeros(5);

%% Electron Trajectories and Temperature
% The following code is very similar to that used in Question 1. The main
% difference is the addition of scattering. Using the probability of
% scattering equation, seen below,the probability of scattering was
% determined and compared to a random number between 0 and 1. If the
% number is less than the probability of scattering, the electron will
% scatter. This means that it will be given new velocity component values,
% calculated using the Gaussian distribution as was done above. Lastly, the
% every time the electron scatters, the time and distance since its last
% scatter is recorded.

% $$P_{scat}= 1 - e^{-{dt}/{\tau_{mn}}}$$

%% Mean Free Path and Time Between Collisions
% The actual Mean Free Path is found by taking the mean of the scattering
% distances. 

actualMFP = mean(scatterDistances);

%%
% The actual Mean Free Path  is $2.10 * 10^{-8} m$, which is very close to the
% expected value of $2.6449*10^{-8}m$. 

%The actual time between collisions is found by taking the average of the
%time beteen scattering. 
actualTBC = mean(scatterTimes);

%%
% The time between collisions  is $1.79 * 10^{-13} s$, which is close to the
% expected value of $2 * 10^{-13}s$.
